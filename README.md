Implementations associated with the paper "Accelerated inference for stochastic compartmental models with over-dispersed partial observations"


An assumed density approximate likelihood is derived for a class of partially observed
stochastic compartmental models which permit observational over-dispersion. This is
achieved by treating time-varying reporting probabilities as latent variables and integrating them out using Laplace approximations within Poisson Approximate Likelihoods (LawPAL), resulting in a fast deterministic approximation to the marginal likelihood and filtering
distributions. We derive an asymptotically exact filtering result in the large population
regime, demonstrating the approximationâ€™s ability to recover latent disease states and reporting probabilities. Through simulations we: 1) demonstrate favorable behavior of the
maximum approximate likelihood estimator in the large population and time horizon regime
in terms of ground truth recovery; 2) demonstrate order of magnitude computational speed
gains over a sequential Monte Carlo likelihood based approach, and explore the statistical
compromises our approximation implicitly makes. We conclude by embedding our methodol-
ogy within the probabilistic programming language Stan for automated Bayesian inference to
develop a model of practical interest using data from the Covid-19 outbreak in Switzerland.
